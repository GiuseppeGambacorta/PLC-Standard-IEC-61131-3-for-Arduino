<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Hi, i am an ex PLC programmer and sometimes i do some small home projects on arduino or esp32. I'm used to work with professional IDEs to program PLCs with all the necessary tools and functions and I immediately noticed that some commands that in PLC programming are taken for granted here on arduino are not present, so I thought about creating them from 0 in order to simplify my life when I have to work on some of my projects.
I am sharing my little library here so that everyone can use and improve it

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Just download the library and import it by adding <plc.h> in your project, you will also find some examples in the dedicated folder.


## Usage

I will add some explanation for every object, for now i have attached some examples and a link to the [Codesys Documentation](https://help.codesys.com/webapp/idx-Standard-lib;product=Standard;version=3.5.17.0)
